# EditableListbox
Create a listbox where you can edit the rows.
- Each item is a label with its own click events.
- Each item transforms into an Entry while editing the row.

(EditableListbox is Poikilos' fork of David Duran's ListBoxEditable.)


## Differences in Poikilos fork
- Preserve the value when changing to entry mode.
- Store names in a list and generate them separately from the values.
- Press the enter/return key to end entry.
- Use PEP8 such as for:
  - spacing
  - variable and method naming (constant all caps convention, word order
    in grammatically-correct order etc.) such as renaming
    `placeListBoxEditable` to `gridAll`, `ListBoxEditable` to
    `EditableListbox`, etc.
  - module naming
  - private method `_` convention
  - Move documentation comments to docstrings.
- See [changelog.md](changelog.md) for more.
